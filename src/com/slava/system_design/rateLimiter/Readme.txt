Alternative Problems You Could Practice:
Since you've already done rate limiter, web crawler, log aggregation, and task dependency, here are other good system coding problems:

Distributed Lock Manager - Implement with lease expiration, deadlock detection
Memory Pool Allocator - Custom memory management with different size classes
Thread Pool with Priority Queue - Work stealing, dynamic sizing
Copy-on-Write B+Tree - For MVCC implementation
Distributed Cache with Consistent Hashing - Including cache invalidation
File System Watcher - Using inotify/kqueue with event coalescing
